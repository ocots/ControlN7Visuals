# ControlN7Visuals

## Description

ControlN7Visuals is a Unity project specifically developed for the sake of 3D-visualizing optimal control solutions. It offers a premade Unity scene with custom editor inspector: the user selects PNG solution graphs from the Unity editor and they automatically get added onto a sphere. The project can then be built in order to get a visual demonstration web module, for example.
